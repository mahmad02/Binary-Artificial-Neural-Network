# Binary-Artificial-Neural-Network
Design and test convolution layer of neural network. I interfaced with single port SRAMs, which bottlenecked design. Met timing constraints, minimized area, and no unconstrained paths or latches. Measured performance as product of area, cycles to completion, and clock period
